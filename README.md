# SlackLex

A small example project using [Hedwig](https://hexdocs.pm/hedwig), my own [fork of the slack adapter](https://github.com/matthewoden/hedwig_slack) and the [Lex](https://github.com/matthewoden/lex) library to create a broker between the AWS Lex service and slack.

Hedwig isn't required to use the Lex library - but not every slackbot needs complex natural language processing.

Example is a WIP, based off a personal slackbot. Use at your own peril.
